    <p>
      Founded in 2015 by renowned art curator Dr. Alejandra PersTenas, our gallery has become a
      beacon for contemporary art lovers and collectors worldwide. What started as a small exhibition
      space in the heart of the Creative Quarter has blossomed into a three-floor cultural destination,
      hosting over 50 exhibitions annually and representing more than 80 artists from 25 countries.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>The Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Alejandra PersTenas spent 15 years working with major museums and galleries across Europe
        before returning to her hometown with a vision: to create a space where emerging artists could
        thrive alongside established masters, where innovation met tradition, and where art was
        accessible to everyone, not just the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gallery opened its doors on a rainy November afternoon in 2015 with just 12 artworks and
        a handful of visitors. Word quickly spread about the quality of the curation and the warmth
        of the welcome. Within a year, we had expanded to a second floor and established our now-famous
        artist residency program.

      <h3>Growth and Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        As our reputation grew, so did our ambitions. In 2018, we launched our international artist
        exchange program, bringing creators from Tokyo to São Paulo to showcase their work. In 2020,
        despite global challenges, we pioneered virtual gallery tours and online exhibitions, reaching
        audiences in over 60 countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, PersTenas Art Gallery stands as a testament to the power of art to connect, inspire,
        and transform. Our 15,000 square foot space includes three exhibition halls, a sculpture
        garden, artist studios, a conservation lab, and an educational center where we host workshops,
        lectures, and community events.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <article>
      <p>
        At PersTenas, we believe art is not a luxury but a necessity. Our mission encompasses three
        core pillars:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Artist Empowerment:</strong> We provide artists with fair compensation, creative
        freedom, and the resources they need to push boundaries. Our 70/30 commission split favors
        the artist, and we never demand exclusivity.</li>

        <li><strong>Collector Education:</strong> We demystify the art world, helping new collectors
        build confidence while providing seasoned collectors with access to emerging talents before
        they become household names.</li>

        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Art belongs to everyone. Our free public programming,
        school partnerships, and subsidized exhibition access ensure that financial barriers never
        prevent someone from experiencing the transformative power of art.</li>
      </ol>
